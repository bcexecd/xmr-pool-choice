### xmr-pool-choice

基於Latency和網絡去中心化程度，協助使用者選擇適當的門羅(Monero)礦池。包含一個事先準備好的礦池 JSON 資料庫。這個修改版僅適用於 Windows 10 Traditional Chinese Version。

Toolkit for helping to choose the right Monero minging pool based off of latency and decentralization of the network. Also, a json database containing the most recent accepted pool names, mining addresses, and live stats APIs is included.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- [tabulate](https://txt.arboreus.com/2013/03/13/pretty-print-tables-in-python.html) for seeing the results
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) for interacting with the pool APIs

### Linux Usage
For a fresh Linux install, follow these commands to download the python3 packages required
```
	sudo apt install python3-pip
	pip3 install tabulate requests
	git clone https://github.com/timekelp/xmr-pool-choice
	cd xmr-pool-choice
	python3 run.py
```

### Windows Usage
Download Python3, I prefer the [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) distrubtion from Anaconda. Download the Python 3.5 exe installer and follow the instructions. Download a copy of this repository to a location of your choice, then run
```
	cd "<repository-location>\xmr-pool-choice"
	conda install pip
	pip install requests tabulate
	python run.py
```

### OSX Usage
Download Python3 if you don't already have it, I prefer the [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) distrubtion from Anaconda. Download the Python 3.5 bash installer and follow the instructions. Download or git clone a copy of this repository to a location of your choice, then run
```
	cd <repository-location>\xmr-pool-choice
	conda install pip
	pip install requests tabulate
	python run.py
```
General note: it takes a few minutes to get the data from the network so please allow the script to run to completion. An example output (for an eastcoast based miner) would look like
```
The top 10 pools based on latency are listed below. 
It is recommended to chose a low latency, reliable, 
and small pool with <10 % Network Hashrate. 
The full results are written to the text file pool_results.txt

### Plans for recommendation
Looking to develop some metric that can be calculated from the data this script acquires. This could then provide a way to suggest top pools for a miner to join that is beneificial to the miner as well as the network decentralizaition.

### Future features
- Calculate average block per day to give a miner how many additions to their account they can expect
- Choose pools from a certain region you would like to only choose from. 
- Incorporate tabulate and requests into the code base so they don't need to be installed ahead of time.


This code relies on the data gathered by the folk(s) at [moneropools.com](http://moneropools.com) and [supportXMR.com](http://supportXMR.com) for maintaing all of the pool information. Check them out.
